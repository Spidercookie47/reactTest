Simple instructions to set up and run the project.

## Setup and Run

**Step 1: Open the project**
- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Go to `File` > `Open Folder...` and select the project folder.

**Step 2: Run the project**
- Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code by selecting `Terminal` > `New Terminal`.
- Type the following command in the terminal and press Enter:
npm run dev


This will start the development server. Once running, you can view the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser (or the appropriate URL based on the output in your terminal).

if not u can use CMD in windows

- Type cd reactTest 
- Run the following command to start the development server:npm run dev


Once the server starts, if the default port is in use, it will select the next available port. Look for the line in the terminal that says `Local:` followed by an address like `http://localhost:5174/`. Open this address in your web browser to view the application.
